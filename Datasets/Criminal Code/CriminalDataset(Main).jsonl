{"instruction": "Describe application of Clause 308(a) in practical scenarios", "input": "According to Clause 308(a), what does the statute of limitation mean for criminal cases?", "output": "Clause 308(a) sets a time limit within which criminal complaints must be filed after the commission of an offense under this Chapter. This means that once this period has elapsed, no further complaints can be lodged, and the case cannot proceed in court. Consult The National Criminal (Penal) Code, 2017 AD, Nepal for authoritative interpretation."}
{"instruction": "Explain exceptions to Clause 308(b)", "input": "According to Clause 308(b), are there any circumstances under which the time limit can be extended?", "output": "Clause 308(b) outlines exceptions where the statutory time limit for filing complaints can be extended. These may include scenarios such as concealment of the offense, absence or incapacity of the complainant, or any other reasons deemed appropriate by the court. Consult The National Criminal (Penal) Code, 2017 AD, Nepal for authoritative interpretation."}
{"instruction": "Identify procedural steps under Clause 308(c)", "input": "According to Clause 308(c), what are the steps involved in ensuring prompt action against offenses?", "output": "Clause 308(c) specifies that law enforcement and prosecution authorities must investigate and prosecute offenses within the specified time limit. This includes gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, charging the accused, and bringing the case to trial. Consult The National Criminal (Penal) Code, 2017 AD, Nepal for authoritative interpretation."}
{"instruction":"Explain the fundamental prohibition in Clause 206","input":"What is the core legal principle established by Clause 206?","output":"Clause 206 establishes a universal prohibition: no person shall subject or cause any person to be subjected to enforced disappearance. This is an absolute, unconditional legal ban that applies to all actors—state officials, organizations, and private individuals—without exception or circumstance."}
{"instruction":"Define the scope of Clause 206's application","input":"Who does Clause 206 protect and who does it bind?","output":"Clause 206 protects every person from enforced disappearance and binds every person—police, military, civilian, organized group, or unorganized group—from committing it. The law makes no distinction between state and non-state actors; all are equally prohibited and equally punishable."}
{"instruction":"Explain the legal structure of Clause 206","input":"How is Clause 206 organized to address enforced disappearance?","output":"Clause 206 is structured with a blanket prohibition, a detailed definition with two sub-categories (state actors under 2(a) and non-state actors under 2(b)), and provisions for liability, sentencing, and aggravating circumstances. This ensures comprehensive coverage of all enforced disappearance scenarios."}
{"instruction":"Identify what makes enforced disappearance a crime","input":"What transforms detention into an illegal enforced disappearance under Clause 206?","output":"Enforced disappearance becomes a crime when: (1) a person is arrested, detained, or controlled, (2) they are not produced before legal authority within 24 hours (excluding travel time), AND (3) information about their location, condition, or reason for deprivation is concealed. All three elements must be present together."}
{"instruction":"Distinguish Clause 206 from general detention laws","input":"Why does Clause 206 specifically target concealment rather than merely detention?","output":"Most detention is lawful when procedurally transparent—documented, with court presentation and family notification. Clause 206 criminalizes the secrecy element: concealment prevents access to family, legal counsel, and courts, transforming lawful detention into an arbitrary human rights violation. Concealment is the distinguishing criminal factor."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(1) in legal terms","input":"What does Clause 206(1) state about enforced disappearance?","output":"Clause 206(1) provides: 'No person shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any one to enforced disappearance.' This is an absolute prohibition with no exceptions. It criminalizes both direct commission and causation—ordering or enabling another person to commit it are equally culpable."}
{"instruction":"Explain the dual liability in Clause 206(1)","input":"Does Clause 206(1) cover both the person committing disappearance and those who cause it?","output":"Yes. The phrase 'subject or cause to be subjected' captures two forms of liability: (1) direct perpetrators who physically conduct the disappearance, and (2) persons who cause others to do it through orders, pressure, or facilitation. Both are equally criminalized."}
{"instruction":"Clarify the universality of Clause 206(1)","input":"Does the prohibition in Clause 206(1) apply to police, military, and civilians equally?","output":"Yes, absolutely. Clause 206(1) uses the universal term 'no person,' making no distinction based on authority, office, or status. Police, military, government officials, and private civilians are all equally bound by this prohibition and equally subject to prosecution."}
{"instruction":"Explain the strength of Clause 206(1)'s language","input":"What does 'shall subject' mean in Clause 206(1)?","output":"'Shall' is mandatory language indicating legal obligation, not discretion. The prohibition is categorical and non-waivable. No circumstances, emergencies, orders, or justifications can excuse enforced disappearance. 'Subject' means to place under constraint, control, or deprivation of liberty."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(1) to facilitation scenarios","input":"If someone provides a location for hiding a detainee, are they liable under Clause 206(1)?","output":"Yes. Providing a location is 'causing' enforced disappearance—the person facilitates the crime even without conducting the detention themselves. Under Clause 206(1), both the detainer and the person providing the hiding place are liable for subjecting or causing disappearance."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(2)(a) - state actor definition","input":"What specific acts constitute enforced disappearance by government authorities under Clause 206(2)(a)?","output":"Clause 206(2)(a) defines state enforced disappearance as: arrest, detention, or control of a person by authorized personnel, followed by failure to produce them before court within 24 hours (excluding travel time), and/or refusal to allow contact with the person, and/or concealment of information about location, condition, or how they are held."}
{"instruction":"Explain the 24-hour requirement in Clause 206(2)(a)","input":"Why is the 24-hour presentation deadline critical in Clause 206(2)(a)?","output":"The 24-hour rule (excluding travel time) is a key safeguard: if authorities detain someone and fail to present them before the case-trying authority within this window, it constitutes enforced disappearance. This deadline prevents secret indefinite holding and ensures rapid judicial oversight of lawful detention."}
{"instruction":"Clarify concealment in Clause 206(2)(a)","input":"What forms of concealment trigger enforced disappearance under Clause 206(2)(a)?","output":"Concealment under Clause 206(2)(a) includes: denying the arrest occurred, refusing to reveal the detainee's location, refusing family/counsel contact, failing to record detention officially, hiding the condition of the detainee, or providing false information about whereabouts. Any action obscuring detention information constitutes concealment."}
{"instruction":"Distinguish lawful from unlawful detention in Clause 206(2)(a)","input":"How does Clause 206(2)(a) differentiate between legal detention and enforced disappearance?","output":"Legal detention requires documenting the arrest, presenting the person in court within 24 hours, notifying family/counsel, and providing transparent information. Clause 206(2)(a) defines unlawful disappearance when authorities fail any of these—particularly the 24-hour presentation or when they conceal any aspect of detention."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(2)(a) to official conduct","input":"If police arrest someone but cannot find them for 3 days and deny holding them, does Clause 206(2)(a) apply?","output":"Yes, absolutely. Elements present: (1) arrest by authorized personnel, (2) failure to present within 24 hours, (3) concealment (denying custody). This precisely matches Clause 206(2)(a)'s definition. The police conduct violates the law even if the person is eventually released."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(2)(b) - non-state actors","input":"What specific acts constitute enforced disappearance by non-state actors under Clause 206(2)(b)?","output":"Clause 206(2)(b) defines non-state enforced disappearance as: abduction, custody, control, or any deprivation of liberty of a person by any person, organization, or group (organized or unorganized), followed by concealment of information about the reason for deprivation, location, condition, or how the person is held."}
{"instruction":"Explain the scope of Clause 206(2)(b)","input":"Who can commit enforced disappearance under Clause 206(2)(b)?","output":"Any person, organized group, or unorganized group can commit enforced disappearance under Clause 206(2)(b). This includes: individual kidnappers, criminal gangs, militia groups, terrorist organizations, or loose associations of people. The law makes no distinction—all are equally liable."}
{"instruction":"Clarify abduction vs. detention in Clause 206(2)(b)","input":"Does Clause 206(2)(b) require that the person be kidnapped, or can it apply to consensual custody?","output":"Clause 206(2)(b) uses 'abduction, custody, control, or any form of deprivation of liberty'—this captures both forced taking and any unlawful holding. Whether the person is kidnapped or detained without consent, if their location and condition are concealed, it constitutes enforced disappearance under Clause 206(2)(b)."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(2)(b) to group scenarios","input":"If a criminal gang abducts a person and hides them in a secret location, telling no one why or where, does Clause 206(2)(b) apply?","output":"Yes, directly. Elements: (1) abduction/deprivation of liberty by non-state actors (gang), (2) concealment of information about reason, location, and condition. This precisely fits Clause 206(2)(b). All gang members involved are liable as offenders."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(3) - order-givers and implementers","input":"Are order-givers and those who execute orders equally liable under Clause 206(3)?","output":"Yes. Clause 206(3) states: 'A person who orders the commission of enforced disappearance and a person who implements such order shall be considered to be the principal offender of enforced disappearance.' Both bear equal liability as principal offenders, not as accomplices or accessories."}
{"instruction":"Clarify principal offender status in Clause 206(3)","input":"Why does Clause 206(3) treat order-givers as principal offenders rather than accomplices?","output":"Clause 206(3) elevates order-givers to principal offender status because ordering a grave crime reflects direct intent and responsibility. The law rejects the excuse that 'I only gave orders, I didn't do it.' Both the mind (order-giver) and the hand (implementer) bear equal criminal responsibility."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(3) to command structures","input":"If a military officer orders soldiers to secretly detain a suspect, is the officer liable as a principal offender?","output":"Yes. Under Clause 206(3), the officer who gives the order is a principal offender, equal in liability to the soldiers who execute it. The officer faces the same penalties as the soldiers—up to 15 years imprisonment and fine of 500,000 rupees."}
{"instruction":"Explain implementation vs. facilitation in Clause 206(3)","input":"Does Clause 206(3) only apply to those who directly execute orders, or to facilitators too?","output":"Clause 206(3) applies to those who implement orders—those who directly carry out the enforced disappearance. Facilitators (those who help in minor ways) are covered differently under sentencing provisions. Clause 206(3) focuses on principal offender status for order-givers and implementers."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(3) to indirect orders","input":"If a leader says 'handle this person,' and subordinates interpret it as an order to disappear them, is the leader liable under Clause 206(3)?","output":"Liability depends on intent. If the leader's statement was reasonably interpreted as an order for enforced disappearance, Clause 206(3) applies. However, if ambiguous, the prosecution must prove the leader intended the statement to order disappearance. Clear, explicit orders carry stronger liability."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(4) - public official and organization leader liability","input":"How does Clause 206(4) differ from Clause 206(3) in holding public officials liable?","output":"Clause 206(4) specifically addresses public officials and organization leaders: when they order enforced disappearance, they are treated as the primary principal offender. This elevates their liability beyond Clause 206(3)—public authority amplifies criminal responsibility. The person giving the order bears primary liability."}
{"instruction":"Clarify public office in Clause 206(4)","input":"What qualifies as 'holding public office' under Clause 206(4)?","output":"Public office includes government positions: police officers, military personnel, judges, prosecutors, civil servants, and elected officials. These positions confer legal authority to arrest, investigate, or enforce law. Clause 206(4) holds them especially accountable because they abuse public authority to commit enforced disappearance."}
{"instruction":"Explain organization leader in Clause 206(4)","input":"What does 'responsible person of an organization' mean in Clause 206(4)?","output":"Organization leader refers to the person directing any organization or group—criminal gang leaders, militant group commanders, organized crime bosses, or even unorganized group heads. Whether the organization is legal, illegal, organized, or unorganized, the leader giving the order for enforced disappearance is the principal offender under Clause 206(4)."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(4) to police hierarchy","input":"If a police commissioner orders a superintendent to disappear a suspect, who bears primary liability under Clause 206(4)?","output":"The commissioner, as the public official giving the order, bears primary liability as principal offender under Clause 206(4). The superintendent who implements it is also a principal offender under Clause 206(3), but the commissioner's public authority makes them the primary focus of liability."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(4) to organized crime","input":"If a gang leader orders members to abduct and hide a person, is the leader liable under Clause 206(4)?","output":"Yes. Under Clause 206(4), the gang leader as 'responsible person of an organization' who gives the order is liable as principal offender. The organized status of the group doesn't matter—whether it's a formal gang or loose criminal association, the leader's order creates primary liability."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(5) - superior responsibility","input":"What are the conditions for a superior's liability under Clause 206(5)?","output":"Clause 206(5) requires three conditions: (1) the superior knows or should know a subordinate is committing or about to commit enforced disappearance, (2) the superior has authority to prevent it, and (3) the superior disregards the information or fails to take necessary measures. Meeting all three creates liability."}
{"instruction":"Clarify knowledge in Clause 206(5)","input":"What level of knowledge does a superior need to incur liability under Clause 206(5)?","output":"Clause 206(5) requires actual or constructive knowledge: direct awareness of disappearance, or clear warning signs the superior deliberately ignores. Genuine ignorance due to lack of information access may provide a defense. But willful blindness—ignoring obvious indicators—constitutes sufficient knowledge for liability."}
{"instruction":"Explain preventive measures in Clause 206(5)","input":"What action is required to prevent liability under Clause 206(5)?","output":"A superior must take 'necessary measures to prevent' enforced disappearance: investigating complaints, ordering subordinates to cease, documenting the misconduct, reporting to higher authorities, removing perpetrators, or implementing oversight. Passive awareness or minimal response is insufficient—active prevention is mandatory."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(5) to police command","input":"A police chief receives multiple complaints about officers hiding detainees but takes no action. Is the chief liable under Clause 206(5)?","output":"Yes. The chief has knowledge (complaints), authority to investigate and punish, and fails to take necessary measures. Inaction constitutes guilt under Clause 206(5). The chief becomes an offender even without directly participating in disappearances."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(5) to institutional negligence","input":"If a superintendent knows disappearances are occurring but claims to be too busy to investigate, is liability avoided?","output":"No. Clause 206(5) holds superiors liable for disregarding information or failing to take measures—'too busy' is not a valid defense. The gravity of enforced disappearance demands that superiors prioritize prevention. Neglect due to administrative burden does not escape liability."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(6) - joint commission liability","input":"When enforced disappearance is committed by multiple persons jointly, how is liability determined under Clause 206(6)?","output":"Clause 206(6) provides: all persons involved in joint commission of enforced disappearance are equally liable as offenders. No distinction is made based on roles—the person who grabbed the victim, the driver, the guard, and the person providing shelter are all equal principal offenders."}
{"instruction":"Clarify equal liability in Clause 206(6)","input":"Does Clause 206(6) mean all co-offenders receive identical sentences?","output":"Clause 206(6) means all are equally liable as offenders—subject to the same maximum penalties (15 years + 500,000 rupees). However, sentencing provisions allow courts discretion in imposing specific sentences based on degree of participation, though one actor cannot receive less punishment than another due to a secondary role."}
{"instruction":"Explain joint vs. separate commission in Clause 206(6)","input":"Is there a difference between joint commission and separate acts of enforced disappearance?","output":"Yes. Clause 206(6) applies when multiple persons jointly commit a single enforced disappearance—they act together in concealing one person. If each person separately disappears different victims, each is an individual offender. The law treats coordinated, unified criminal acts differently."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(6) to criminal groups","input":"If 5 gang members abduct a person together—one grabs, one drives, one guards, one provides shelter, one collects ransom—are all equally liable?","output":"Yes. All five are joint participants in the single enforced disappearance. Under Clause 206(6), each is an equal principal offender despite different roles. Each faces up to 15 years imprisonment and 500,000 rupees fine. No one can claim a lesser penalty for a supporting role."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(6) to planned vs. opportunistic crimes","input":"Does Clause 206(6) apply to spontaneous group disappearances, or only pre-planned ones?","output":"Clause 206(6) applies regardless of whether the disappearance was planned or spontaneous. The key is joint commission—if multiple persons knowingly participate together in concealing someone's location and condition, they are all equally liable under Clause 206(6). Prior planning is irrelevant."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(7)(a) - principal offender penalties","input":"What are the penalties for principal offenders under Clause 206(7)(a)?","output":"Clause 206(7)(a) provides: principal offenders face imprisonment for a term not exceeding 15 years and/or a fine not exceeding 500,000 rupees. Courts consider 'the duration and circumstances of such enforced disappearance' in determining the specific sentence within these maximums."}
{"instruction":"Clarify sentencing discretion in Clause 206(7)(a)","input":"Can courts impose less than 15 years for enforced disappearance under Clause 206(7)(a)?","output":"Yes. Clause 206(7)(a) provides a maximum of 15 years—courts have discretion to impose less. The actual sentence depends on duration and circumstances: longer disappearances, multiple victims, violence, or vulnerable victims may yield longer sentences; shorter periods with no additional crimes may yield lesser terms."}
{"instruction":"Explain fine calculation in Clause 206(7)(a)","input":"Is the fine of 500,000 rupees mandatory or discretionary under Clause 206(7)(a)?","output":"The fine is discretionary. Clause 206(7)(a) states 'a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand rupees'—courts can impose any amount up to this maximum, including lower fines or no fine. However, serious cases typically impose substantial fines alongside imprisonment."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(7)(a) to sentencing scenarios","input":"How would courts sentencing a police officer who disappeared a suspect for 5 days apply Clause 206(7)(a)?","output":"The officer is a principal offender. Courts would consider 5 days as moderate duration and the officer's abuse of authority as serious circumstances. A plausible sentence might be 8-12 years imprisonment plus 300,000-500,000 rupees fine, well within the Clause 206(7)(a) maximums."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(7)(b) - accomplice penalties","input":"What sentence do accomplices and conspirators face under Clause 206(7)(b)?","output":"Clause 206(7)(b) provides: accomplices and conspirators receive 'the same sentence as is imposable on the principal offender'—up to 15 years and 500,000 rupees fine. They face identical penalties to principals, emphasizing that conspiracy and accompliceship carry full criminal weight."}
{"instruction":"Explain facilitator penalties in Clause 206(7)(b)","input":"What sentence applies to those who facilitate or attempt enforced disappearance under Clause 206(7)(b)?","output":"Clause 206(7)(b) provides: facilitators and those who attempt enforced disappearance receive 'half the sentence imposable on the principal offender'—up to 7.5 years and up to 250,000 rupees fine. This reduced penalty reflects lesser participation than principals or accomplices."}
{"instruction":"Distinguish accomplices from facilitators in Clause 206(7)(b)","input":"How does Clause 206(7)(b) differentiate between accomplices and facilitators?","output":"Accomplices directly participate in the enforced disappearance—helping detain, conceal, or control the victim. Facilitators provide indirect support—lending a vehicle, providing a hiding place, or offering information. Accomplices face full penalties; facilitators face half."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(7)(b) to complicity scenarios","input":"If a person supplies a warehouse for hiding a disappearance victim, are they an accomplice or facilitator?","output":"Likely a facilitator. Providing a location is indirect support—important but not direct participation in the detention and concealment itself. Under Clause 206(7)(b), they would face half the principal offender's maximum: up to 7.5 years and 250,000 rupees fine."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(7)(b) to conspiracy scenarios","input":"If two people plan enforced disappearance but only one carries it out, are both accomplices under Clause 206(7)(b)?","output":"Yes. Conspiracy means agreeing and taking steps toward the offense. Under Clause 206(7)(b), both the planner and executor are accomplices, facing the full principal offender sentence: up to 15 years and 500,000 rupees. Conspiracy removes the facilitator classification."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(8) - vulnerability enhancement","input":"How does Clause 206(8) enhance penalties when the victim is a woman or child?","output":"Clause 206(8) provides: when enforced disappearance is committed against a woman or child, an additional 2 years of imprisonment applies, in addition to the Clause 206(7) sentence. This raises the maximum for principal offenders from 15 years to 17 years."}
{"instruction":"Clarify child definition in Clause 206(8)","input":"What age defines a 'child' for Clause 206(8)'s enhanced penalty?","output":"Clause 206(8) refers to 'child' without specifying an age, but Nepalese law typically defines a child as any person under 18 years. The enhancement reflects special legal protection for minors due to their vulnerability. A 17-year-old would qualify for the 2-year enhancement."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(8) to victim vulnerability","input":"Does Clause 206(8) apply only to very young children, or any minor?","output":"Clause 206(8) applies to all children—the entire category of minors. The rationale is that all children are vulnerable populations deserving enhanced protection. Whether a 5-year-old or a 17-year-old, the 2-year enhancement applies if the victim is a child."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(8) to gendered violence","input":"If a woman is disappeared for extended periods and tortured, does Clause 206(8) provide adequate protection?","output":"Clause 206(8) adds 2 years for targeting a woman—raising the maximum to 17 years. However, torture during disappearance triggers Clause 206(9) (additional punishment for compound offenses), which may provide additional enhancements. The combined provisions can yield significantly higher sentences."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(8) to sentencing","input":"What sentence might apply to enforcing disappearance of a 14-year-old child for 10 days?","output":"Base: up to 15 years (Clause 206(7)(a)). Enhanced for child victim: +2 years (Clause 206(8)). Maximum available: 17 years. Court might impose 10-14 years based on duration and circumstances, reflecting the seriousness of targeting a minor."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(9) - compound offense penalties","input":"How does Clause 206(9) handle additional crimes committed during enforced disappearance?","output":"Clause 206(9) provides: when additional crimes occur during disappearance (torture, sexual assault, theft, murder), the offender faces both the enforced disappearance sentence and additional punishment for the compound offense. These may run consecutively, substantially increasing total imprisonment."}
{"instruction":"Clarify compound offense in Clause 206(9)","input":"What crimes trigger the 'additional offense' provision in Clause 206(9)?","output":"Any crime 'punishable by law' committed against the disappeared person during their disappearance qualifies: torture, sexual assault, robbery, assault, unlawful imprisonment beyond the disappearance itself, extortion, or even murder. The list is unlimited—any legally defined offense applies."}
{"instruction":"Explain cumulative penalties in Clause 206(9)","input":"Can sentences under Clause 206(9) run consecutively to the enforced disappearance sentence?","output":"Yes. Clause 206(9) requires 'additional sentence...in addition to the sentence imposable by law for such offence.' This language suggests consecutive sentencing: the disappearance sentence plus the separate sentence for the compound crime. Total imprisonment could exceed 15 years significantly."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(9) to torture scenarios","input":"If authorities disappear a person and torture them for information, how are they sentenced?","output":"Under Clause 206(9), the offender faces: (1) enforced disappearance penalty (up to 15 years), plus (2) torture penalty (potentially 5-10 years depending on torture law), plus (3) possible enhancements for vulnerable victims or state property use. Total could reach 25+ years."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(9) to sexual violence","input":"If a person is disappeared and sexually assaulted, how does Clause 206(9) apply?","output":"Under Clause 206(9), the offender faces: (1) enforced disappearance sentence (up to 15 years), plus (2) separate sexual assault sentence (potentially severe under sexual violence laws), plus (3) enhancements if victim is woman/child (Clause 206(8)). Sentences run cumulatively."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 206(10) - state property misuse penalty","input":"What additional punishment applies when government resources are used for enforced disappearance under Clause 206(10)?","output":"Clause 206(10) provides: if enforced disappearance is committed using government vehicles, buildings, weapons, ammunition, or other goods, an additional 1 year of imprisonment applies. This raises the maximum for principal offenders from 15 years to 16 years."}
{"instruction":"Clarify government property in Clause 206(10)","input":"What qualifies as 'government vehicle, building, arms and ammunition or goods' under Clause 206(10)?","output":"Government property includes: state vehicles (police cars, military trucks), government buildings (police stations, military facilities), weapons and ammunition, official equipment, or any other state-owned assets. The provision targets misuse of public resources for private crimes."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(10) to official conduct","input":"If police use a marked police vehicle to abduct someone, does Clause 206(10) apply?","output":"Yes, directly. The marked police vehicle is government property. Under Clause 206(10), the base enforced disappearance sentence (15 years) increases by 1 year to a maximum of 16 years for misusing official resources. This reflects the aggravation of state abuse."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(10) to facility misuse","input":"If military personnel detain someone in a military barracks, is Clause 206(10) triggered?","output":"Yes. Military barracks are government property. The military facility used for enforced disappearance triggers Clause 206(10)'s 1-year enhancement. Maximum sentence increases from 15 years to 16 years. If combined with other enhancements (child victim +2 years), total reaches 18 years."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(10) to cumulative enhancements","input":"If a public official disappears a child using government vehicles, what sentence applies?","output":"Multiple enhancements combine: Clause 206(4) - public official as principal offender (base 15 years), Clause 206(8) - child victim (+2 years = 17 years), Clause 206(10) - government property use (+1 year = 18 years). Maximum available: 18 years imprisonment and fine up to 500,000 rupees."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 206(10) to civilian crimes","input":"If a criminal uses a stolen government vehicle for kidnapping, does Clause 206(10) apply?","output":"Yes. The provision applies whenever government property is used, regardless of the user's status. A civilian using a stolen state vehicle for enforced disappearance still triggers Clause 206(10)'s 1-year enhancement. The property's ownership, not the perpetrator's status, determines applicability."}
{"instruction":"Explain the fundamental prohibition in Clause 219","input":"What is the core legal principle established by Clause 219?","output":"Clause 219 establishes an absolute prohibition: 'No one shall commit rape.' This is a universal, non-negotiable legal ban protecting all persons from sexual violence. The clause defines rape broadly and establishes graduated penalties based on victim age, distinguishing between child and adult victims."}
{"instruction":"Define the scope of Clause 219's protection","input":"Who is protected under Clause 219 and who is prohibited from rape?","output":"Clause 219 protects every woman and girl child from rape. The prohibition applies universally to all men, including husbands (though with reduced penalties in marital context). No exception, justification, or relationship status exempts a man from the rape prohibition."}
{"instruction":"Explain the legal structure of Clause 219","input":"How is Clause 219 organized to address rape?","output":"Clause 219 is structured as: (1) a blanket prohibition, (2) a detailed definition with age-based vulnerability distinctions, (3) graduated sentencing based on victim age, (4) special provisions for marital rape, (5) HIV/STD transmission enhancements, (6) gang rape and vulnerability enhancements, and (7) incestuous rape provisions."}
{"instruction":"Identify what constitutes rape under Clause 219","input":"What acts are defined as rape under Clause 219?","output":"Rape under Clause 219 includes: sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent, or with any girl child under 18 regardless of consent. This encompasses penis penetration into vagina, anus, or mouth, as well as insertion of objects into the vagina. Consent obtained through coercion, intimidation, or misrepresentation doesn't count."}
{"instruction":"Distinguish Clause 219 from consent-based definitions","input":"Why does Clause 219 treat all sexual intercourse with girls under 18 as rape even with consent?","output":"Clause 219 recognizes that children under 18 lack legal capacity to consent to sexual activity. Their developmental status makes them inherently vulnerable to manipulation and exploitation. This reflects international standards protecting child sexual integrity—consent by a minor is legally void regardless of expressed agreement."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(1) - the prohibition","input":"What does Clause 219(1) state about rape?","output":"Clause 219(1) provides: 'No one shall commit rape.' This is an absolute, unconditional prohibition. The use of 'no one' makes clear that the law applies universally—without exception for relationship, status, or any circumstance. It is the foundational legal protection against sexual violence."}
{"instruction":"Clarify the universality of Clause 219(1)","input":"Does the rape prohibition in Clause 219(1) apply equally to all men?","output":"Yes, absolutely. Clause 219(1) uses 'no one,' applying uniformly to all men regardless of status, authority, occupation, or relationship to the victim. Police, military, husbands, and civilians are all equally prohibited from committing rape."}
{"instruction":"Explain the absolute nature of Clause 219(1)","input":"Are there any circumstances where rape is permitted under Clause 219(1)?","output":"No. Clause 219(1) contains no exceptions or qualifications. No emergency, military necessity, interrogation justification, or relationship status—not even marriage—exempts anyone from the rape prohibition. It is absolute and inviolable."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(1) to relationship contexts","input":"Can a husband ever legally rape his wife under Clause 219(1)?","output":"Clause 219(1) prohibition applies to all men including husbands. However, Clause 219(4) provides a separate, reduced sentencing regime for marital rape. Husbands can be prosecuted for rape, but face different penalties than unmarried perpetrators."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(1) to authority figures","input":"Can police or military personnel be charged with rape under Clause 219(1)?","output":"Yes, absolutely. Police and military are bound by Clause 219(1) equally. Their official authority is irrelevant to the rape prohibition. A police officer who commits rape faces prosecution and punishment just as a civilian would."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(2) - consent without it","input":"What is the key principle of Clause 219(2) regarding consent?","output":"Clause 219(2) states that sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent constitutes rape. Additionally, any sexual intercourse with a girl child under 18 is rape even if she gives consent—children cannot legally consent to sexual activity. Consent is central to adult rape; irrelevant for child rape."}
{"instruction":"Clarify the age distinction in Clause 219(2)","input":"How does Clause 219(2) differentiate between adult women and girl children?","output":"For women 18+: rape requires lack of consent. For girls under 18: rape occurs automatically regardless of consent. This reflects legal principle that minors lack capacity for informed sexual consent. The law presumes all intercourse with children is exploitative."}
{"instruction":"Explain coerced consent in Clause 219(2)","input":"What does Clause 219(2) say about consent obtained through coercion?","output":"The Explanation to Clause 219(2) specifies: 'Consent obtained by way of coercion, undue influence, intimidation, threat, misrepresentation, or kidnapping or taking of hostage shall not be considered to be consent.' These vitiate consent entirely—coerced agreement is legally void."}
{"instruction":"Explain unsound mind in Clause 219(2)","input":"What happens to consent when the woman is of unsound mind?","output":"The Explanation clarifies: 'Consent obtained at the time of being of unsoundness of mind shall not be considered to be consent.' A woman unable to understand or appreciate the nature of sexual intercourse due to mental illness, intoxication, or other causes cannot consent. Any intercourse is rape."}
{"instruction":"Expand sexual acts in Clause 219(2)","input":"What penetration acts constitute rape under Clause 219(2)?","output":"The Explanation specifies: 'The penetration of penis into anus or mouth, penetration of penis to any extent into anus, mouth or vagina, insertion of any object other than penis into vagina shall also be considered to be rape.' Rape includes all forms of penetration, not just vaginal intercourse."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(2) to manipulation","input":"If a man uses lies to obtain intercourse with a woman, is it rape under Clause 219(2)?","output":"Yes. Clause 219(2) explicitly states that consent obtained by 'misrepresentation' is not valid consent. If he deceives her about his identity, status, intentions, or other material facts, consent is void and intercourse constitutes rape."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(2) to intoxication","input":"If a woman is intoxicated and agrees to intercourse, is it rape under Clause 219(2)?","output":"Yes, likely. Intoxication can constitute 'unsoundness of mind' under the Explanation. If the woman cannot appreciate the nature and consequence of intercourse due to intoxication, she cannot consent. Intercourse with an intoxicated woman is presumptively rape."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(2) to minors","input":"If a 16-year-old girl agrees to sexual intercourse with an adult, is it rape under Clause 219(2)?","output":"Yes, absolutely. Clause 219(2) explicitly states that intercourse with a 'girl child below eighteen years of age' constitutes rape 'even with her consent.' Her agreement is irrelevant. The law treats all persons under 18 as legally incapable of consenting to sex."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(2) to threatened consent","input":"If a man threatens a woman with harm if she doesn't consent, and she agrees, is it rape?","output":"Yes, definitively. The Explanation states consent obtained by 'threat' is not valid consent. Threatened consent is legally void. Under Clause 219(2), this constitutes rape regardless of her verbal agreement."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(3) - sentencing structure","input":"How does Clause 219(3) structure rape penalties?","output":"Clause 219(3) provides graduated sentences based on victim age: under 10 years (16-20 years), 10-14 years (14-16 years), 14-16 years (12-14 years), 16-18 years (10-12 years), and 18+ years (7-10 years). Younger victims receive longer sentences, reflecting their greater vulnerability."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(3)(a) - child under 10","input":"What sentence applies for rape of a child under 10 years under Clause 219(3)(a)?","output":"Clause 219(3)(a) provides: 'Imprisonment for a term of sixteen to twenty years.' This is the most severe rape sentence, reflecting the extreme gravity of child rape. The courts must impose between 16 and 20 years based on specific circumstances."}
{"instruction":"Clarify sentencing discretion in Clause 219(3)(a)","input":"Must rape of a child under 10 result in exactly 20 years imprisonment?","output":"No. Clause 219(3)(a) provides a sentencing range: 16 to 20 years. Courts exercise discretion within this range based on circumstances—violence during rape, infection with diseases, multiple assailants, or prior offenses may increase sentence; other factors may lower it within the range."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(3)(b) - child 10-14","input":"What sentence applies for rape of a girl aged 10-14 under Clause 219(3)(b)?","output":"Clause 219(3)(b) provides: 'Imprisonment for a term of fourteen to sixteen years.' This reflects that girls aged 10-14 are also highly vulnerable. The 14-16 year range applies, slightly reduced from the under-10 category but still severe."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(3)(c) - child 14-16","input":"What sentence applies for rape of a girl aged 14-16 under Clause 219(3)(c)?","output":"Clause 219(3)(c) provides: 'Imprisonment for a term of twelve to fourteen years.' Girls aged 14-16 receive 12-14 years. The reduced range from younger categories reflects that slightly older adolescents have marginally greater capacity for self-protection, though still legally incapable of consent."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(3)(d) - girl 16-18","input":"What sentence applies for rape of a girl aged 16-18 under Clause 219(3)(d)?","output":"Clause 219(3)(d) provides: 'Imprisonment for a term of ten to twelve years.' Girls aged 16-18 receive 10-12 years. This is reduced from younger girls, but still substantial—the law recognizes they're still minors with limited capacity for resistance or legal recourse."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(3)(e) - woman 18+","input":"What sentence applies for rape of a woman 18 and above under Clause 219(3)(e)?","output":"Clause 219(3)(e) provides: 'Imprisonment for a term of seven to ten years.' Adult women receive 7-10 years. This is reduced from child victims, though still severe. The reduced range assumes adult women have greater capacity for resistance, reporting, and legal agency."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(3) to sentencing scenarios","input":"How would courts sentence a perpetrator who raped a 12-year-old child?","output":"Under Clause 219(3)(b), the perpetrator faces 14-16 years. Courts might impose 15 years as a middle-range sentence. If aggravating factors exist (violence, use of weapons, threats, gang rape), courts move toward the 16-year maximum. Absent aggravation, courts might impose 14-15 years."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(3) to discretionary sentencing","input":"Can a court impose 8 years for raping an adult woman under Clause 219(3)(e)?","output":"Yes. Clause 219(3)(e) permits 7-10 years. A court could impose 8 years if specific circumstances warrant leniency—for example, a first-time offender with minimal violence and other mitigating factors. However, this would be on the lower end."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(4) - marital rape exception","input":"Does the rape prohibition apply to husbands under Clause 219(4)?","output":"The prohibition applies, but Clause 219(4) provides a special regime: a husband who rapes his wife during the marital relationship faces 'a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years'—far less than non-marital rape. This is a controversial reduced penalty for spousal rape."}
{"instruction":"Clarify the marital relationship requirement in Clause 219(4)","input":"When does Clause 219(4)'s reduced penalty apply?","output":"Clause 219(4) applies only 'during the existence of marital relationship between them.' The provided proviso clarifies that marital relationship doesn't exist if: (a) a partition suit has been instituted, (b) the wife has taken her partition share and separated, or (c) a divorce has been instituted. Legally separated spouses don't qualify."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(4) to separated couples","input":"If a husband rapes his separated wife before divorce is finalized, does Clause 219(4) apply?","output":"Likely not, if she has established separate residence. Clause 219(4)'s proviso states the relationship doesn't exist if 'the wife has lived separate upon taking her partition share.' Physical separation and independent residence suggest the relationship has ended, removing Clause 219(4)'s reduced penalty protection."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(4) to divorce scenarios","input":"If a man rapes his ex-wife after divorce, does Clause 219(4) apply?","output":"No. Clause 219(4)'s proviso specifies it doesn't apply if 'a case of divorce from the husband has been instituted.' Once divorce is filed or finalized, the marital relationship legally ends. Rape of an ex-wife is prosecuted as non-marital rape under Clause 219(3)(e), yielding 7-10 years, not Clause 219(4)'s 5 years maximum."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(4) to living together","input":"If a husband and wife live together but have a separation agreement, does Clause 219(4) apply?","output":"Uncertain, depending on the agreement's terms. Clause 219(4) requires actual marital relationship existence. If they formally agreed to separation with intentions to divorce and live apart, the relationship likely has ended despite shared housing. Courts would examine the substantive relationship status."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(5) - protection orders","input":"What remedies can courts order under Clause 219(5) in marital rape cases?","output":"Upon the victim's petition, courts may order the husband to: (a) allow her residence, provide food/clothes, not hurt her, behave decently, (b) arrange medical treatment, (c) reside separately if needed and maintain her, or (d) refrain from causing suffering or annoyance and ensure her security. These are non-criminal remedial orders."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(5) to victim protection","input":"In a marital rape case, can a court order the husband to vacate the home?","output":"Yes. Clause 219(5)(c) allows courts to 'arrange a separate residence for the husband if it is not appropriate for them to reside in the same place together.' A court can order him to leave and provide maintenance for the wife. This protects her from ongoing abuse."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(5) to medical care","input":"If a marital rape victim needs medical care, what can courts order?","output":"Clause 219(5)(b) allows courts to order the husband to 'get the wife to have required medical treatment or provide reasonable amount for her treatment.' Courts can mandate he pay for trauma counseling, STD treatment, or physical injury care. This ensures the victim receives necessary support."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(6) - HIV transmission","input":"What additional punishment applies if a man commits rape knowing he has HIV?","output":"Clause 219(6)(a) provides additional sentences per Section 105 for HIV-positive rape. This likely carries severe punishment (potentially 5-10 additional years) for deliberately transmitting a life-threatening disease. The provision targets intentional disease transmission."}
{"instruction":"Clarify HIV liability in Clause 219(6)","input":"Must the man intend to transmit HIV, or is knowing he's positive enough?","output":"Clause 219(6)(a) states 'in spite of knowing that he has human immune deficiency virus (HIV positive).' This requires knowledge of his status, but the phrase 'in spite of' suggests recklessness—proceeding despite knowing the risk of transmission. Intent to transmit may not be required, only knowledge and recklessness."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(6)(b) - other STDs","input":"What punishment applies for rape while knowing of other sexually transmitted diseases?","output":"Clause 219(6)(b) provides: 'A sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and a fine not exceeding thirty thousand rupees.' This is less severe than HIV penalties, but still substantial—up to 3 years additional imprisonment plus 30,000 rupees fine for deliberately transmitting other STDs."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(6) to disease transmission","input":"If a man commits rape knowing he has gonorrhea, what sentences apply?","output":"Base rape sentence (7-10 years for adult women under Clause 219(3)(e)) plus Clause 219(6)(b) enhancement (up to 3 additional years and 30,000 rupees fine). Total potential imprisonment: up to 13 years plus 30,000 rupees fine, depending on circumstances."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(7) - gang rape and vulnerability","input":"What additional punishment applies for gang rape under Clause 219(7)?","output":"Clause 219(7) provides 'an additional sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years' for: (a) gang rape (rape by multiple persons), (b) rape of pregnant women over 6 months, (c) rape of infirm or disabled women, (d) rape of mentally/physically ill women, or (e) rape showing arms/weapons."}
{"instruction":"Clarify gang rape in Clause 219(7)","input":"How many perpetrators constitute 'gang rape' under Clause 219(7)?","output":"Clause 219(7) states 'commits rape on a woman in a gang'—implying multiple perpetrators (typically 2 or more). All gang members are liable for the additional 5-year enhancement. This reflects the greater trauma and danger of multiple simultaneous assailants."}
{"instruction":"Explain pregnancy protection in Clause 219(7)","input":"Why does Clause 219(7) enhance punishment for raping pregnant women?","output":"Clause 219(7) protects pregnant women specifically—'rape of a woman having pregnancy of more than six months'—because pregnancy creates dual vulnerability: physical fragility and the fetus's safety. Rape of a pregnant woman risks physical injury to both mother and unborn child."}
{"instruction":"Clarify disability/illness in Clause 219(7)","input":"What disabilities or illnesses trigger Clause 219(7)'s enhancement?","output":"Clause 219(7) applies to women 'infirm or disabled or suffering from physical or mental illness.' Infirmity means weakened condition; disability means physical or mental impairment; mental illness means psychiatric conditions. Any of these reduces resistance capacity and increases vulnerability."}
{"instruction":"Explain weapons display in Clause 219(7)","input":"What does 'showing arms' mean in Clause 219(7)?","output":"'Showing arms' means displaying weapons during rape—brandishing guns, knives, or other weapons to threaten and control the victim. This adds extreme fear and trauma, justifying the 5-year enhancement. Weapon display aggravates the offense beyond the rape itself."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(7) to multiple enhancements","input":"If a man commits gang rape of a pregnant woman with a weapon, what sentences apply?","output":"Base rape sentence (e.g., 7-10 years for adult woman under Clause 219(3)(e)) plus Clause 219(7) enhancement for all three factors (gang rape, pregnancy, weapon display). The enhancement is 'not exceeding five years,' so potentially up to 15 years total, depending on courts' discretionary application."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(7) to physical vulnerability","input":"If a man rapes a disabled woman who cannot physically resist, does Clause 219(7) apply?","output":"Yes, directly. Clause 219(7) specifies rape of women 'infirm or disabled.' Her disability makes her particularly vulnerable and unable to resist. The court would add the enhancement (up to 5 years) to the base rape sentence, recognizing his exploitation of her weakness."}
{"instruction":"Explain Clause 219(8) - incestuous rape","input":"How does Clause 219(8) address rape within family relationships?","output":"Clause 219(8) states that rape within prohibited degrees of relationship by consanguinity or affinity (close family relations) results in sentences 'in addition to the sentence imposable for incest.' This creates cumulative liability—punishment both for rape and for the separate crime of incest."}
{"instruction":"Clarify prohibited relationships in Clause 219(8)","input":"What relationships are 'prohibited degree' under Clause 219(8)?","output":"Prohibited degrees typically include: parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts/uncles, and in-laws within close proximity. The exact list is defined elsewhere in Nepalese law, but the principle is that closely-related family members are prohibited from sexual relations, and rape compounds this violation."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(8) to cumulative sentences","input":"If a man commits rape of his sister, is he sentenced for both rape and incest?","output":"Yes. Clause 219(8) imposes 'the sentence referred to in this Chapter'—the rape sentence under Clause 219—'in addition to the sentence imposable for incest.' Both crimes are punished cumulatively. He faces separate sentences for rape (7-10 years) and incest, increasing total imprisonment."}
{"instruction":"Apply Clause 219(8) to in-laws","input":"If a man rapes his sister-in-law, does Clause 219(8) apply?","output":"Possibly, depending on whether the sister-in-law relationship is within 'prohibited degree of relationship by affinity.' Some jurisdictions prohibit affinal relationships within the first degree; others extend further. The specific relationship determines applicability."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for age tiers","input":"Why does Clause 219(3) create different sentences for different victim ages?","output":"Age tiers recognize graduated vulnerability: children under 10 are most vulnerable and defenseless, deserving maximum protection (16-20 years). As age increases, children develop marginally greater capacity for self-protection. At 18, presumed legal adulthood begins (7-10 years). The tiered system reflects developmental psychology."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for consent","input":"Why does Clause 219(2) treat consent obtained through coercion as non-consent?","output":"Coerced consent is legally void because the woman's autonomy is negated. True consent requires voluntary agreement free from pressure. Coercion, threats, or misrepresentation override the victim's will, reducing her to passive compliance rather than genuine agreement. The law protects bodily autonomy, not mere silence."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for marital exception","input":"Why does Clause 219(4) provide a reduced penalty for marital rape?","output":"This reflects a controversial legal principle: historically, marriage was viewed as implying ongoing consent to intercourse. Modern laws increasingly reject this, but Clause 219(4) preserves the reduced penalty—a compromise reflecting societal ambivalence about state intervention in marital relationships. This is criticized by human rights advocates."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for HIV enhancement","input":"Why does Clause 219(6) impose additional penalties for HIV transmission?","output":"HIV transmission during rape creates lifelong, life-threatening consequences for the victim—beyond the immediate trauma. The law treats deliberate disease transmission as a separate, compounding violation. Enhanced penalties reflect the severity of imposing a chronic, incurable disease on a victim."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for gang rape","input":"Why does Clause 219(7) enhance penalties for gang rape?","output":"Gang rape involves multiple perpetrators amplifying trauma, danger, and humiliation. Each assailant may add different injuries or violations. The collective violence is more severe than single-perpetrator rape. The enhancement recognizes the multiplicative harm when a victim is assaulted by multiple men simultaneously."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for weapon display","input":"Why does Clause 219(7) enhance penalties when weapons are shown?","output":"Weapons during rape add terror, threat, and danger of lethal harm. A victim facing armed assailants cannot safely resist and is faced with threats of death or serious injury. Weapons transform rape into a potentially life-threatening assault, justifying enhanced punishment."}
{"instruction":"Understand legislative intent for vulnerable victims","input":"Why does Clause 219(7) protect pregnant, disabled, and ill women specifically?","output":"These populations have reduced capacity for resistance: pregnant women are physically fragile, disabled/ill women are compromised. The law recognizes they're at heightened risk and cannot effectively defend themselves. Enhanced penalties protect those most vulnerable to exploitation."}
{"instruction":"Compare Clause 219(3)(a) vs 219(3)(e)","input":"Why is rape of a 9-year-old (16-20 years) more severely punished than rape of an adult (7-10 years)?","output":"Children's absolute vulnerability and the permanent psychological damage of child sexual abuse justify maximum sentences for young victims. Adults have marginally greater capacity for resistance and recovery. The 16-20 year vs 7-10 year differential reflects that child rape is categorically more heinous."}
{"instruction":"Compare marital vs. non-marital rape","input":"Why does Clause 219(4) reduce marital rape penalties (5 years max) vs. non-marital rape (7+ years minimum)?","output":"This reflects legal tradition viewing marriage as implying ongoing consent—now controversial. The reduced penalty suggests courts view marital rape as less severe than stranger rape. Modern jurisprudence increasingly rejects this distinction, viewing marital rape as equally heinous."}
{"instruction":"Compare Clause 219(6)(a) vs 219(6)(b)","input":"Why are HIV-related penalties more severe than general STD penalties?","output":"HIV is a lifelong, incurable, AIDS-causing virus—far more serious than treatable STDs like gonorrhea. The law reflects this medical reality: HIV transmission creates permanent health consequences and shortened lifespan, justifying harsher punishment (Section 105's potentially 5-10 years) vs. STD penalties (max 3 years)."}
{"instruction":"Explain the prohibition in Clause 285(2)(a)","input":"What does Clause 285(2)(a) prohibit regarding property damage?","output":"Clause 285(2)(a) prohibits any person from destroying or diminishing the value, importance, or utility of government, public, or private property with the intent, knowledge, or negligence to cause harm or loss."}
{"instruction":"Clarify the intent requirement in Clause 285(2)(a)","input":"Is intent required to violate Clause 285(2)(a)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(a) covers acts done intentionally, knowingly, or negligently that damage government, public, or private property, so both deliberate and reckless acts are punishable."}
{"instruction":"Describe the scope of Clause 285(2)(a)","input":"Which properties are protected under Clause 285(2)(a)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(a) protects government, public, and private properties, including buildings, land, utilities, and any property under government or private ownership."}
{"instruction":"Explain why Clause 285(2)(a) exists","input":"Why is Clause 285(2)(a) important?","output":"Clause 285(2)(a) exists to prevent serious damage to property that could harm public interests, government operations, or private ownership, ensuring accountability for such acts."}
{"instruction":"Summarize Clause 285(2)(a)","input":"What is the key takeaway from Clause 285(2)(a)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(a) establishes that destroying or damaging property, whether intentional or negligent, is criminal mischief punishable by law."}
{"instruction":"Explain the prohibition in Clause 285(2)(b)","input":"What does Clause 285(2)(b) prohibit regarding public utilities?","output":"Clause 285(2)(b) prohibits causing loss, damage, or obstruction to public or private sewerage, water canals, drinking water ponds, roads, bridges, or other means of communication or transportation."}
{"instruction":"Clarify the intent requirement in Clause 285(2)(b)","input":"Is negligence included under Clause 285(2)(b)?","output":"Yes, Clause 285(2)(b) covers acts that cause damage or obstruction intentionally, knowingly, or negligently, holding the person responsible regardless of intent."}
{"instruction":"Describe the scope of Clause 285(2)(b)","input":"Which infrastructures are protected under Clause 285(2)(b)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(b) protects utilities such as sewerage systems, canals, drinking water ponds, roads, bridges, and any transportation or communication infrastructure."}
{"instruction":"Explain why Clause 285(2)(b) exists","input":"Why was Clause 285(2)(b) enacted?","output":"Clause 285(2)(b) ensures the protection of essential public and private infrastructure, preventing disruption of utilities, transportation, or communication services."}
{"instruction":"Summarize Clause 285(2)(b)","input":"What is the key takeaway from Clause 285(2)(b)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(b) establishes liability for anyone causing damage or obstruction to public or private infrastructure, ensuring protection of essential services."}
{"instruction":"Explain the prohibition in Clause 285(2)(c)","input":"What does Clause 285(2)(c) prohibit regarding signs and public information?","output":"Clause 285(2)(c) prohibits destroying, removing, erasing, or tampering with any public sign or mark, spreading rumors, or using deception, except under orders from a competent authority."}
{"instruction":"Clarify intent in Clause 285(2)(c)","input":"Does Clause 285(2)(c) require intent?","output":"Clause 285(2)(c) applies to acts done intentionally, knowingly, or negligently that interfere with public signs or information, ensuring accountability for misleading or damaging actions."}
{"instruction":"Describe the scope of Clause 285(2)(c)","input":"Which actions are covered under Clause 285(2)(c)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(c) covers tampering with public signs, spreading false information, or deceiving people through marks or signs meant for public convenience."}
{"instruction":"Explain the purpose of Clause 285(2)(c)","input":"Why does Clause 285(2)(c) exist?","output":"Clause 285(2)(c) exists to protect public convenience, ensure clarity of information, and prevent deception or confusion caused by tampering with public signage."}
{"instruction":"Summarize Clause 285(2)(c)","input":"What is the main point of Clause 285(2)(c)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(c) criminalizes acts that tamper with public signs or mislead the public, safeguarding information and public order."}
{"instruction":"Explain the prohibition in Clause 285(2)(e)","input":"What does Clause 285(2)(e) prohibit regarding correspondence?","output":"Clause 285(2)(e) prohibits concealing or dishonestly delaying the delivery of correspondence, notices, parcels, or other objects belonging to another person."}
{"instruction":"Clarify intent in Clause 285(2)(e)","input":"Is negligence covered under Clause 285(2)(e)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(e) holds individuals accountable whether the act is intentional, knowing, or negligent, ensuring delivery obligations are respected."}
{"instruction":"Describe the scope of Clause 285(2)(e)","input":"Which items are protected under Clause 285(2)(e)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(e) protects all types of correspondence, notices, parcels, and objects of another person from being withheld or delayed dishonestly."}
{"instruction":"Explain the purpose of Clause 285(2)(e)","input":"Why does Clause 285(2)(e) exist?","output":"Clause 285(2)(e) ensures timely delivery of correspondence and protects the property rights of individuals, preventing dishonest interference."}
{"instruction":"Summarize Clause 285(2)(e)","input":"What is the key takeaway from Clause 285(2)(e)?","output":"Clause 285(2)(e) makes it a criminal offense to conceal or delay another person's correspondence or objects, ensuring accountability and protection of property rights."}
