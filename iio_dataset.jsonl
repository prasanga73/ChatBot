However, each individual joint promisor is not automatically liable for others' performance unless clause 529(4) provides otherwise.\n\nIf a third party performs an obligation made by another joint promisor, the paying party can recover damages from other joint promisors in proportion to their contribution to fulfilling the obligations under the contract.
