If a trustee does not fulfill their duties as required by law (subsection 1), they are considered to have breached trust. This breach makes them responsible for any loss or damage caused to the beneficiary and liable to compensate accordingly (subsection 2). The liability includes compensating for profits that would have been earned had the trust not been breached (subsection 3). If there are multiple trustees, all who commit a breach of trust share joint responsibility (subsection 4). However, if only part of the trust is breached while another part provides benefits, these benefits cannot be used to fulfill the trustee's liability (subsection 5). There are exceptions where the trustee is not liable, such as when losses result from legal operations or prior trustees' actions (subsection 6). Additionally, specific acts like failing to perform trust-related duties, improperly disposing of trust property, or embezzlement are deemed breaches of trust under subsection 7.

If no specific compensation is mentioned, you can seek a reasonable amount for direct and actual losses only—indirect or remote losses are not recoverable. Additionally, if the contract includes provisions for extending the completion period with payment of compensation, the paying party may request an extension proportional to the compensation paid. Importantly, receiving compensation under this clause does not prevent you from pursuing other legal remedies available for the breach."

A conditional contract means that certain conditions must be fulfilled before the obligations under the contract take effect. If these conditions are not met, the contract may be void or unenforceable. This affects legal implications by creating dependencies on external factors, which could influence the enforceability and rights of both parties involved in the transaction.

If a seller does not actually hold the title at the time of sale, this can lead to legal complications for the buyer, such as claims from third parties or disputes over ownership. The clause also ensures that the goods are free from any third-party custody, control, or possession. In cases of future sales agreements, the seller is expected to have or obtain the title by the agreed time.
