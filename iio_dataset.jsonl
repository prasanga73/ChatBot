These include contracts that restrain someone from exercising a profession, trade or business that is not prohibited by law. For example, if a buyer and seller conclude a contract that restrains the seller from carrying on similar trade or business under such goodwill for the time and at the place specified in the contract, this would be considered void. Similarly, contracts between partners to restrain them from doing the same profession, trade or business as that of the partnership firm or any other profession, trade or business together with other persons who are competitors of the same nature other than the profession, trade or business of the partnership firm until the partnership exists would also be considered void. Additionally, contracts concluded between the partners to restrain someone from exercising a profession, trade or business of the partnership firm for a certain reasonable period or at a certain place after being separated from the partnership would be considered void. Finally, contracts so concluded between a person and any person, firm, company or body that the person is restrained from accepting the service of another person, firm, company or body who is the competitor of such other person, firm, company or body until the person is in the service of, or for a specified period after retirement from the service of, such other person, firm, company or body would also be considered void."
